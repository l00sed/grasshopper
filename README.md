## Getting Started

1. Add a new panel with your 'Username' and 'Email' to link to your GitHub account.

2. Double-click the boolean toggle ("Initialize") to allow GitHopper to recognize the existence of the repo.

	- The "Status" panel should now read: `The git repository initialized successfully`

3. Drag the number slider to choose from the available branches.

4. You can click the 'git pull' button to download the latest files / grasshopper script to your local machine. However, I recommend using an actual terminal to pull before opening Rhino at all.

## Pushing to Remote

1. After making changes, *SAVE* your grasshopper file.

2. Click the 'git add' button to add your updated files

3. Click the 'git commit' button to commit your changes with the optional "Commit Message" text (you can change this in the panel, default is "updated").

4. Click the 'git push' button to push to the remote repo. You should receive a pop-up to put in your GitHub credentials. If the pop-up closes without any additional dialog, you might want to try again (you probably didn't enter your password correctly).
